# jsondict
A lightweight package for Python that creates a jsondict type by extending (and limiting) the built-in dict and automatically storing dictionaries as json files, as well as separating out nested lists and dictionaries into a jsondict subfolder that allows dynamic loading of large nested json dictionaries.
